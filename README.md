# What is this?
I create this repositories to use the jekyllbootstrap with plugin enabled.

I have created a [blog](http://chouqin.github.com) on GitHub using GitHub pages and Jekyll-Bootstrap,
but github don't let me to use plugin on it, 
so I follow the instructions of [this site](http://charliepark.org/jekyll-with-plugins/) 
and create a repository with plugin enabled, using this repository to genearate pages on the github. 
So this repository is just the 'source code' of [chouqin.github.com](https://github.com/chouqin/chouqin.github.com).
